This Python project utilizes several modules to automate the process of creating a new repository on GitHub and linking it to a local project. The main functionality is achieved through Selenium WebDriver, which interacts with the GitHub website.

The potential use cases for this project include:

1. **Automation of repetitive tasks**: By automating the creation of a new GitHub repository and linking it to a local project, developers can save time and effort that would be spent manually creating repositories and configuring links.
2. **Streamlining project setup**: The automation process can simplify the initial setup of a new project by automatically creating the necessary repository and linking it to the local files.
3. **Collaboration facilitation**: By automating the creation of a GitHub repository, developers can easily share their work with others and collaborate on projects.

The usefulness of this project lies in its ability to simplify and streamline tasks related to GitHub repository creation and linking, making it an efficient tool for developers working with version control systems.
